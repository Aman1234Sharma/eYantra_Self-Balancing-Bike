## 🎯 Overview  
This project is part of the e‑Yantra competition. The goal is to build a self‑balancing two‑wheeled vehicle (bike) that maintains balance using sensors, actuators, and control software — combining mechanical, electronics, and embedded software skills.

## 🛠️ Features & Modules  
- **Task 0: Software Installation and Testing** — Set up the development environment and validate the simulation tools.  
- **Task 1: Simulation** — Virtual prototype of the self‑balancing vehicle using simulation platforms.  
- **Task 3: Starting Stuff** — Initial hardware interface, sensor integration (IMU, gyroscope/accelerometer).  
- **Task 4: Hardware Implementation** — Build of the physical bike platform, motor drivers, control board.  
- **Task 5: Mini Theme Implementation** — Mini Demonstration of Theme goal  .  
- **Task 6: Final Theme Implementation** — Complete end‑to‑end system: balancing + theme challenge.

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- CoppeliaSim installed 
- C++ and Python   
- Arduino 


## ✅ How You Can Use or Extend It  
- Modify the balancing algorithm (e.g., PID/LQR) for improved performance.  
- Integrate additional sensors (ultrasonic, LiDAR) for obstacle avoidance.   
- Design custom mechanical frame for better stability or aesthetics.
